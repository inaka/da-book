Phonebook Exercise in Angular.JS

## Introduction
This repo is an exercises for Angular.JS candidates applying for a job at [Inaka](http://inaka.net/jobs)

## The Excercise
Write an phonebook app where the backend is an api written in ruby and serving json, and the frontend is an angularjs application:

  - the app needs to allow basic operations in the phonebook entries: insert, view, edit, delete
  - the phonebook entries only have name, phone and email fields
  - you should use a single github repository
  - you can't use rails to create the api server, other frameworks are allowed
  - in angularjs it's required to use angular-ui-router component
  - make sure you can click on an entry in phonebook list and view/edit in the right side, changing the browser url properly
  - the page should be responsive
